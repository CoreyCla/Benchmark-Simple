# Benchmark-Simple
This is a simple application I wrote to help me check the amount of time certain functions take to run. Right now it only displays time, but in the future it will also display number of iterations, throughput, and other useful benchmark metrics.
The data provided is mock data that I generated on mockaroo.com
